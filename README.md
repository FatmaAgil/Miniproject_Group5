# Sphere Snake Game

A modern 2D Snake game built using `pygame`, featuring a vibrant gradient background, a gradient snake, and gradient food. The objective is to collect food to grow the snake while avoiding collisions with the wall and the snake's own body. The game gets progressively harder as the snake's speed increases with each food item eaten.

## Features

- **Gradient Background**: Smooth vertical gradient from Light Sky Blue to Midnight Blue.
- **Gradient Snake**: Snake represented by spheres with a radial gradient effect.
- **Gradient Food**: Food appears as a circle with a gradient color, respawning after being eaten.
- **Score System**: The score increases as the snake eats food.
- **Increasing Difficulty**: Snake's velocity increases after eating food.
- **Game Over Screen**: Displays "Game Over" when the snake collides with the wall or itself.
- **Congratulations Screen**: Displayed upon reaching a score of 100.
